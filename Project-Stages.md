## Overview
This file shows what has been done on different phases of the Multi-Cloud-infra Project using Terraform.
I haven't figured out the end goal of this project yet, but its better late than never to start and figure out on the way. For now let's go as it goes.

## Stage-1 (29-Aug-2024)
1. At this beginning phase, I've set up the terrafrom, Azure CLI & AWS CLI and wrote the terraform code on VSCode. I've first created the respective cloud provider accounts and accessed the required credentials and connected the terraform to the cloud providers.
2. Once the bridge is set-up, I created the Virtual Networks and Subnets on both Azure and AWS.
